## Description

This application is a simple text editor. However, it runs as a progressive web app, so that once it loads it can function without an internet connection, and can even be installed as an app on the local machine, resulting in the browser not being needed to use it. I wanted to build a simple PWA! I used the starter code from my class for this project. A large number of global internet users are still using unstable 3G internet connections, so PWAs can play an important role in overcoming those connection issues. I learned about setting up a PWA using webPack while doing this project.

## Installation

Hit the install button!

## Usage

Once the page loads, the user can enter text, leave the window, and come back and the text will still be there. Text is stll lost when the page is refreshed. The text persists from the browser to the installed app, though. To install the app, press the install button.
